# Simple 2048

## Background

Just a simple implementation of the game 2048 written in ReactJS. The aim of the game is to reach the 2048 tile. When moving tiles around, two of the same numbered tiles can merge and add together.

## [Live Demo](https://simple-2048.netlify.app/)

Use the up/down/left/right arrow keys to play. 

### Todo

* Add animations to sliding, merging and new spawning tiles
* Add a score and high score display
* Add a restart button
* Fix an issue where a non sliding/merging move does not spawn a new tile
