# [Simple 2048](https://simple-2048.netlify.app/)

Just a simple implementation of the game 2048 written in ReactJS. The aim of the game is to reach the 2048 tile. Use the up/down/left/right arrow keys to play. 

### Todo

* Add animations to sliding, merging and new spawning tiles
* Add a score and high score display
* Add a restart button
* Fix an issue where a non sliding/merging move does not spawn a new tile
